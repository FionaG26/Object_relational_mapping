# Personal Library Database Management System

## Overview

Welcome to the Personal Library Database Management System project! This system is designed to help you manage your personal library by providing a convenient way to store, organize, and retrieve information about your book collection.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directory structure:

```
library_management_system/
├── data/
├── library_db.sqlite3
├── models/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── __pycache__/
│   ├── create_tables.py
│   └── models.py
└── scripts/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── __pycache__/
    ├── add_book.py
    └── populate_database.py
```

- **data/**: This directory is intended for storing any data files related to the project.
- **library_db.sqlite3**: The SQLite database file where the library data is stored.
- **models/**: This directory contains Python scripts for creating database tables and defining data models.
  - **__init__.py**: An empty file to treat the directory as a Python package.
  - **__pycache__/**: Automatically generated cache files by Python.
  - **create_tables.py**: Script to create tables in the database.
  - **models.py**: Script defining data models for the library database.
- **scripts/**: This directory contains Python scripts for specific tasks related to the library management system.
  - **__init__.py**: An empty file to treat the directory as a Python package.
  - **__pycache__/**: Automatically generated cache files by Python.
  - **add_book.py**: Script to add a new book to the library database.
  - **populate_database.py**: Script to populate the database with sample data.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and start using the Personal Library Database Management System:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd library_management_system`
3. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.x).
4. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the `create_tables.py` script to set up the database tables: `python models/create_tables.py`
6. Optionally, run the `populate_database.py` script to add sample data to the database: `python scripts/populate_database.py`

Now, your Personal Library Database Management System is set up and ready to use!

## Usage

- To add a new book to the database, run: `python scripts/add_book.py`
- Customize and extend the functionality by modifying the scripts and models as needed.
